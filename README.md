# The project started with the download of 24,172 image files (7.7G) from Princeton's digital libary.  These image files were used in all annotation work and annotation coordinates refer to those images. 

# The group then used makesense.ai to assess project needs and to design the annotation labels and guidelines for each label.  We used those initial annotations to to fine-tune a Yolov5 model on the document segment labels.

We then corrected machine errors and offered active feedback to the model using Mayakovsky.  This resulted in a
